Hi!

Iâ€™ve been interested in software development for as long as I can remember, and I also very much enjoy software architecture and working closely with the business. I strongly believe that understanding the business is a must to make correct trade-offs and writing good software. Speaking of code, I would mainly consider myself a backend developer who doesnâ€™t shy away from the frontend if need be.

I'm into open-source and have created several popular libraries for the JVM platform (for example [Occurrent](https://occurrent.org/), [PowerMock](http://powermock.org/), [Rest Assured](https://rest-assured.io/) and [Awaitility](http://www.awaitility.org/)). I like learning new things and I have experience in different languages such as Java, Kotlin, Clojure, Scala, and Groovy. 

Frequent speaker at user groups, companies and conferences such as Ã–redev, Jazoon, Devoxx, and JFokus.

Besides software, Iâ€™m also intrigued by philosophy, cognition, mathematics, and science in general.
